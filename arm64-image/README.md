This contains a Dockerfile with that is capable of being built natively for ARM64 (in addition to AMD64) that contains dependencies needed for the Jupyter notebooks. This was prompted the fact that running the `pangeo`-based AMD64 image runs about 30x slower in emulation on an ARM64 processor. This has only been tested with the `archive_nwm.ipynb` though, and it will need to be modified for the other notebooks. Eventually this should replace the main `Dockerfile`. Another solution is to get ARM64 builds to work on the `pangeo` images.
